## 🎯 Next Steps (Required Before Testing)

### Step 1: Get Your Clerk Publishable Key

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Sign in or create a free account
3. Create a new application (select "React" as framework)
4. Go to **API Keys** in the left sidebar
5. Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Open `frontend/.env` and replace the placeholder:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_clerk_publishable_key_here
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://polished-puffin-622.convex.cloud
```

### Step 3: Configure Clerk Application Settings

In your Clerk Dashboard:

1. **Redirect URLs**: Add `http://localhost:3000` as an allowed redirect URL
2. **Authentication**: 
   - Enable email/password authentication
   - Enable social logins if desired (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. **User Profile**: 
   - Enable first name and last name fields
   - Enable profile images

### Step 4: Clear Browser Data (Recommended)

Since you're switching authentication providers:
1. Clear browser cookies for `localhost:3000`
2. Clear local storage for `localhost:3000`
3. Or simply use incognito/private browsing mode

### Step 5: Restart the Development Server

The server is already running, but after adding your Clerk key:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing the Migration

Once you've added your Clerk publishable key, test the following:

### 1. Sign Up Flow
- Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up" button
- Complete the Clerk sign-up modal
- Verify you're redirected to `/dashboard`
- Check that your profile info displays correctly

### 2. Sign In Flow
- Sign out using the user button in navbar
- Click "Sign In" button
- Log in with your credentials
- Verify redirect to `/dashboard`

### 3. Dashboard Sync
- After signing in, check browser console (F12)
- Look for "User synced with Convex" message
- Verify your user data shows up on dashboard

### 4. Navigation
- Test the navbar user button
- Verify protected routes work correctly
- Check that sign-out returns you to home page

## 📋 Migration Details

### Authentication Hook Changes

**Before (Kinde):**
```javascript
const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, login, register, logout } = useKindeAuth()
```

**After (Clerk):**
```javascript
const { user, isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useUser()
// For sign-in/sign-up, use components:
<SignInButton mode="modal" redirectUrl="/dashboard">
<SignUpButton mode="modal" redirectUrl="/dashboard">
<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
```

### User Object Property Changes

| Kinde | Clerk |
|-------|-------|
| `user.email` | `user.primaryEmailAddress.emailAddress` |
| `user.given_name` | `user.firstName` |
| `user.family_name` | `user.lastName` |
| `user.picture` | `user.imageUrl` |
| `user.id` | `user.id` (same) |
| `isAuthenticated` | `isSignedIn` |
| `isLoading` | `!isLoaded` |

### Database Schema Changes

The Convex schema has been updated to use generic field names:

**Before:**
```javascript
kindeId: v.string()
// indexed as "by_kinde_id"
```

**After:**
```javascript
userId: v.string()
// indexed as "by_user_id"
```

This makes the schema provider-agnostic and easier to migrate in the future.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Clerk is not defined" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've added your Clerk publishable key to `.env` and restarted the dev server.

### Issue: Sign-in modal doesn't appear
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Clerk publishable key is correct
3. Check that redirect URLs are configured in Clerk Dashboard

### Issue: User data not showing on dashboard
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for Convex errors
2. Verify `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is correct in `.env`
3. Check that Convex is running (`convex dev` in root directory)

### Issue: CSP (Content Security Policy) errors
**Solution**: Already fixed in `vite.config.js` - Clerk domains are whitelisted.
